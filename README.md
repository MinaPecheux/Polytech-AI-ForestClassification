# (Polytech) Machine Learning project: Forest Type classification
This repository contains my work for the Machine Learning class I took at the French school of Engineering Polytech Sorbonne, taught by Patrick Gallinari, Arthur Pajot and Eloi Zablocki.

Here, you will find various scripts:
- the `script` folder provides useful classes and methods to load, shuffle, balance, analyze and display data
- the other files are small examples of basic usage of scikit-learn's algorithms and of these custom objects, and their application to the project's dataset

## Tools & Other references
This project is written in Python and mostly relies on 4 libraries:
- NumPy (for data storing and handling): http://www.numpy.org/
- Pandas (idem): https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/
- scikit-learn (for AI algorithms): https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
- matplotlib (for visualization): https://matplotlib.org/contents.html
